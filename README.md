# motion-explainer

**Ask Claude to explain something. Get a motion-graphics animation you can pause, step through and zoom into.**

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill. One prompt in, one self-contained HTML player out,<br>narrated in English or Spanish if you want.

## How it goes

```text
you    > /motion-explainer how does DNS turn example.com into an IP?

claude > 1. storyboards 10 steps and checks the facts (here: a real dig +trace)
         2. writes a scene, builds it, lints it in headless Chrome
         3. screenshots every step, fixes what looks wrong
         4. opens the player
```

That DNS explainer is real and unedited: [watch it](https://4lxn.github.io/motion-explainer/dns-resolution.html).

## Why it's different

| | What it means for you |
|---|---|
| **A player, not a video** | Play, pause, step with `←` `→`, scrub, change speed. Viewers go at their own pace. |
| **Zoom into anything** | Scroll or pinch to zoom, drag to pan, double-click a box to fly into it. Boxes can hold detail that only appears up close. |
| **One HTML file** | Engine, scene and narration inlined. No network, no CDN, strict CSP. Email it, attach it to a PR, open it offline. |
| **Checks its own work** | Every build is linted for overlaps, text that doesn't fit, arrows through boxes and off-canvas elements. Claude reviews a screenshot of every step before you see it. |
| **Narrated, offline** | Local [Kokoro](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx) voices in English and Spanish, with a voice picker in the player. Nothing leaves your machine. |

## Install

**Needs:** macOS or Linux, Google Chrome or Chromium, `bash`, `openssl`. Nothing from npm or pip.

**Plugin** (Claude Code keeps it updated). In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add 4lxn/motion-explainer
/plugin install motion-explainer@motion-explainer
```

**Or git clone** (update with `git pull`):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/4lxn/motion-explainer ~/.claude/skills/motion-explainer
```

Use one or the other; if both are installed, the plugin wins. Then ask:

```text
/motion-explainer how TCP's three-way handshake works
```

Or just say *"animate this architecture"* or *"explícamelo con una animación"*.

<details>
<summary><b>Something not working?</b></summary>

Run `motion doctor` (plugin installs put `motion` on Claude's PATH) or `~/.claude/skills/motion-explainer/bin/motion doctor` (git clone). It checks Chrome, `openssl` and an end-to-end build, and prints the fix for anything missing.

- **Chrome somewhere unusual:** `export MOTION_CHROME="/path/to/chrome-or-chromium"`
- **Windows:** run it inside WSL with Chromium installed. The built HTML plays in any browser on any OS.
- **Ubuntu 24.04 CI or containers:** headless Chrome needs its sandbox allowed: `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` (this repo's CI does the same).

## Prompts to try

| You want | Ask |
|---|---|
| How a system works | *"/motion-explainer how a request reaches our API: load balancer, auth, cache, database"* |
| An algorithm, step by step | *"animate quicksort on [7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 8]"* |
| An idea that changes over time | *"show why retries without jitter overload a server after an outage"* |
| What went wrong | *"walk through yesterday's outage as an animation, failure path first"* |
| Lots of graphics | *"explain a login flow: icon on every box, a terminal mockup for the curl call, a latency chart, zoom into the auth service, hud theme"* ([result](https://4lxn.github.io/motion-explainer/login-flow.html)) |
| A product or tool | *"explain what Microsoft Access is and its main features, narrated in Spanish"* |
| Onboarding | *"explain our deploy pipeline to a new engineer, with a step for every stage"* |

Graphics are used only where they carry meaning, unless you name them: icons, charts, terminal / browser / phone mockups, kinetic titles, zooms, particles, the `hud` theme or a `glow` backdrop.

Claude reads your code or docs first when the topic is your own system, and says "likely" in the narration for anything it inferred rather than checked.

## Narration: English and Spanish

Each step's narration can be spoken by a local text-to-speech model and embedded in the HTML. Every step waits for its voice to finish.

| Narration language | Voices (picker in the player) | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|
| English | Heart (`af_heart`) | American English |
| Spanish | Dora, Alex, Santa (`ef_dora`, `em_alex`, `em_santa`) | Latin American (set `lang: 'es-es'` for Castilian) |

Only native voices read each language: an English voice reading Spanish keeps its accent, so `motion voice` picks the right voices from the scene's `lang` (or detects the language) and refuses a mismatch.

**Hear the same explainer in both languages:** [What is Microsoft Access?](https://4lxn.github.io/motion-explainer/what-is-access.html) · [¿Qué es Microsoft Access?](https://4lxn.github.io/motion-explainer/que-es-access.html)

<details>
<summary><b>Set up voice (once, about 270 MB, offline afterwards)</b></summary>

Needs `node`, `ffmpeg` and Python 3.

```sh
APP=~/.claude/skills/motion-explainer   # plugin installs: APP=$(dirname "$(dirname "$(command -v motion)")")
V=~/.cache/motion-voice; mkdir -p "$V"; python3 -m venv "$V/venv"
"$V/venv/bin/pip" install -r "$APP/tools/voice-requirements.txt"
for f in kokoro-v1.0.int8.onnx voices-v1.0.bin; do
  curl -L -o "$V/$f" "https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/$f"
done
```

Every dependency is pinned, and the model files are checked against pinned SHA-256 hashes. Then ask Claude to "add narration", or run `motion voice my-topic.scene.js` and build again. More in [REFERENCE.md › Voice](REFERENCE.md#voice-motion-voice-optional).

## Player keys

| Key | Does | Key | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Space` | play / pause | `S` | step mode: pause after each step |
| `←` `→` | previous / next step | `[` `]` | slower / faster |
| scroll, pinch | zoom | `T` | light / dark |
| drag | pan | `V` | narration on / off |
| double-click a box | zoom into it | `?` | all keys |

Add `#4` to the URL to open at step 4.

## Write scenes yourself

The skill drives `bin/motion`, and you can too:

```sh
motion new   my-topic architecture   # start from a template: architecture | algorithm | idea | story
motion build my-topic.scene.js       # inline everything into my-topic.html, then lint it
motion shot  my-topic.html           # one PNG with every step (add 4 or 4@1.5 for one step, mid-motion)
motion open  my-topic.html           # chromeless 1440x900 window
motion voice my-topic.scene.js       # narrate, then build again
motion doctor                        # check the setup
```

(`motion` is on PATH with the plugin; with git clone it's `~/.claude/skills/motion-explainer/bin/motion`.)

A scene is a small JS file: declare every element, then the steps that reveal and move them.

```js
Motion.scene({
  title: 'Cache hit vs miss',
  lang: 'en',
  elements: [
    { id: 'app',   type: 'box', x: 300,  y: 450, label: 'App' },
    { id: 'cache', type: 'box', x: 800,  y: 450, label: 'Cache', tone: 'accent' },
    { id: 'db',    type: 'box', x: 1300, y: 450, label: 'Database', shape: 'db' },
    { id: 'a1', type: 'arrow', from: 'app', to: 'cache' },
    { id: 'a2', type: 'arrow', from: 'cache', to: 'db' },
  ],
  steps: [
    { title: 'Ask the cache first', say: 'The app checks the cache before the database.',
      do: [{ show: ['app', 'cache', 'a1'] }, { flow: 'a1', label: 'GET' }] },
    { title: 'Miss: go to the database', say: 'On a **miss**, the cache asks the database and keeps the answer.',
      do: [{ show: ['db', 'a2'] }, { flow: 'a2' }, { flow: 'a2', reverse: true, label: 'row' }, { pulse: 'cache', tone: 'ok' }] },
  ],
});
```

Errors name the scene line and suggest the closest valid name:

```text
error 'cache': unknown type 'bxo'. Did you mean 'box'?
error step 2: unknown id 'dbb'. Did you mean 'db'?
error js: Uncaught ReferenceError: lable is not defined (my-topic.scene.js:14)
```

Elements: boxes, circles, text, arrows, zones, notes, code panels, icons, charts, terminal, browser and window mockups, kinetic titles, particles. Actions: `show`, `hide`, `set`, `move`, `flow`, `focus`, `camera`, `pulse`, `line` and more. The full format is in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does it need the internet?</b></summary>
Only to install. Building, linting, narrating and playing all run locally, and the built page cannot load anything from the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I share one?</b></summary>
Send the <code>.html</code> file, or host it anywhere static (these demos are on GitHub Pages). Silent explainers are about 100 KB; narration adds roughly 1 MB per voice.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I edit what Claude made?</b></summary>
Yes. Edit the <code>.scene.js</code> (or ask Claude to) and build again. Don't edit the built <code>.html</code>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why not a video, slides or a diagram?</b></summary>
A video plays at one speed and can't be zoomed. Slides lose the movement. A static diagram shows the parts but not the order things happen in. A step player keeps all three: movement, pacing and detail on demand.
</details>

## How it works

```text
scene.js ──► motion build ──► one .html (engine + scene + voice inlined, hash-pinned CSP)
                                 │
                                 ├─► headless Chrome lint  (overlaps, fit, unknown ids, JS errors)
                                 └─► motion shot           (a PNG per step that Claude reviews)
```

`engine/player.js` compiles the scene into tweens and paints SVG. `bin/motion` is plain bash 3.2. `tools/voice.py` runs Kokoro locally.

## Updating and contributing

- **Update:** `claude plugin update motion-explainer@motion-explainer`, or `git -C ~/.claude/skills/motion-explainer pull`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Test:** `test/run.sh` lints every example and runs the player, voice, CLI and lint tests. CI runs it on Ubuntu and macOS.
- **Contribute:** issues and PRs welcome; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## License

[MIT](LICENSE). The optional voice feature downloads Kokoro weights (Apache-2.0) and uses `phonemizer` / espeak-ng (GPL-3.0); they are not bundled here.
